musicDownloader
===============

A music downloader for the russian social network  - http://odnoklassniki.ru

Entire functional code is implemented in AppCore library. musicDownloader it's just demo application which shows how to use this library.
This application is written in C#, so you will need a .NET runtime (.NET Framework 4.5) for run this application (on Windows), because GUI part I wrote in Windows Forms you can't use this application with Mono (on Linux or MacOS). But you can write your own GUI because AppCore is platform independent.
